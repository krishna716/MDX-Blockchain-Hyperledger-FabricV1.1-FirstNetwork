This is a Fabric v1.1.0 network setup with 4 organizations, each having 1 peer and all are part of same channel. 
There are 4 CAs each associated with individual peer. Here I have used solo orderer for this 
network setup. You can use this network setup as basic and modify the configuration files as per your business requirement.

Prerequisite:

-  Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12
-  Docker Engine: Version 17.03 or higher
-  Docker-Compose: Version 1.8 or higher
-  Node: 8.9 or higher (note version 9 is not supported)
-  npm: v5.x
-  git: 2.9.x or higher
-  Python: 2.7.x

Download and install prerequisites(Execute these commands in your home directory):

curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/prereqs-ubuntu.sh

chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh

./prereqs-ubuntu.sh



This project folder is referred as <network>.  
All the commands must be executed from  <network> folder.  
One time setup. The following commands 
  chmod a+x *.sh 
 . ./downloadbin.sh 

 To generated the cryto config and other configurations run the following commands 
 . ./generateartifacts.sh 

To start the netowrk  

  . setenv.sh 
  docker-compose up -d 
  docker ps
To build and join channel. Make sure that network is running 

   docker exec -it cli bash -e ./buildandjoinchannel.sh 

Install and instantiate chain codes
Create the chain code directiory.
As of now I have created that folder in the project and placed one sample chaincode for your testing. So don't need to execute next 3 lines.
1. cd <network> 
2. sudo mkdir -p chaincode/github.com/trialCC 
3. Copy the chain code files in the respectivive directories.

To instantiate and install chaincode:
  docker exec -it cli bash -e  ./trialCC_install.sh
  
To test chaincode:
docker exec -it <peerId> bash
peer chaincode query -C trialchannel -n trialCC -c '{"Args":["query","a"]}'
  
To update the chain code , first update the chain code source files in the above mentioned directory.
Then run the following commands as appropriate

  docker exec -it cli bash -e  ./trialCC_update.sh <version>
